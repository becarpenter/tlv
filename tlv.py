#####################################
# In the dumps() and loads() calls, a
# TLV pattern is the first parameter.
#####################################
#
# The pattern is a list of sizes in bits. For example [8,8]
# means that 2 objects will each be encoded in one byte,
# and the resulting byte string will be 2 bytes long.
# For 'dumps' the objects may be int (>=0, max 2**32-1),
# bytes, Boolean (1 bit) or UTF-8 str.
# For 'loads' all objects except Booleans are returned as bytes; 
# the user must cast them as int or str if needed.

# A (length, value) duple may be encoded # as an 'lv' object.
# In that case the entry in the pattern is the string 'L8'
# for an 8 bit length and 'L16' for a 16 bit length. 
# (Other lengths not currently supported.)

# A (type, length, value) triple may be encoded as a 'tlv' object.
# In that case the entry in the pattern is the string 'T8L8'
# for an 8 bit length and value, or 'T8L16', 'T16L8' or 'T16L16'
# for other combinations. (Other lengths not currently supported.)

# An object of size 0 in the pattern is skipped in 'dumps'
# and returned as 'None' in 'loads'. This is to allow TLV
# tuples with no value, or any other missing field, to be
# handled uniformly

# Here are some example patterns:
#
# [8,16,8,1] - three integers and a Boolean
# [8,1,16,1,8] - integer, Boolean, 2-character string, Boolean, integer
# [8,1,'L8',1,8] - integer, Boolean, an LV duple, Boolean, integer
#
# The LV duple could be, e.g., tlv.lv(32,123456) or tlv.lv(32,'abcd')
#
# [8,'T8L16',1] - integer, TLV triple, Boolean
#
# The TLV triple could be tlv.tlv(17,32,123456)
#
# Note on Booleans: If you want a fully encoded byte, that's
# going to be 8 Booleans [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. But the module allows
# any number of consecutive Booleans in the pattern, and bit shifts
# all subsequent items accordingly, with zero bits to pad the end.
# It's *much* more efficient to put 8 Booleans in a row!
#
# Beware! For strings, the length must be the length in bits, which
# in a UTF-8 string is not the same as 8 times the string length.
# Thus, for example, tlv.lv(32,"300â‚¬") is a mistake.
